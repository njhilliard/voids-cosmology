# Illustris-3 simulation data mining:
Explore void influence on cosmological parameters in the Illustris simulation data set, for cosmology coursework. 

Do local under-dense areas warp perceived observables, and if so, can this be quanitfied? Could this be a factor in the mismatch from Cepheid measurements of the Hubble constant compared to the CMB?
